		  <h2>ENCHANTED RIVER</h2>
		  <p>Located on the island of Mindanao, hidden in the Philippine jungle is a majestic river that appears to pop out of the ground just to send its crystal clear blue waters out to sea. 
		  It is said to be enchanted ‘because no one has ever reached its bottom.’ Despite the fact that many people have already tried to reach the bottom including scuba divers, all of them failed. Hence the start of the legend of its bottomless pit.</p>
