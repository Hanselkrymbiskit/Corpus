		  <h2>MAYON VOLCANO</h2>
		  <p>the main landmark of the Philippine’s Albay Province, rises 2,462 meters (8,077 feet) from the shores of the Gulf of Albay about 10 kilometers (6.2 miles) away. Mount Mayon is truly a mesmerizing countryside view, 
		  especially when peaceful, and symmetrically, this volcano has THE most perfectly-shaped cone in the world. Ironically though, amidst its being very attractive, it is also the most active volcano in the entire Philippines, 
		  with over 49 eruptions in the past 400 years. Both local and foreigner peeps have died, either by seeking thrill over climbing it, or merely by being residents nearby.</p>

		  <h2>HUNDRED ISLANDS</h2>
		  <p>Lying just off the coast of Alaminos, the wonderfully named Hundred Islands National Park 
		     is actually home to 124 islands and islets. Rising from the sparkling waters full of incredible marine life, the limestone islands are often coated in forest, 
			 with many of them also boasting glorious little sandy beaches. Although it’s a very popular tourist destination, many people only visit for a day. To make the most of the 
			 stunning scenery, it is well worth overnighting on an island and spending a few days swimming and snorkeling in the national park’s turquoise waters.</p>
